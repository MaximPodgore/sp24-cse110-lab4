1. Will log 3 because var is a function scope variable and price length is 3
2. Will log 150 because discounted price gets reassigned value each loop and the last value is 300/2 = 150
3. It will log 150, because that's the last discounted price with that round stuff applied to it
4. It will return [50,100,150] because those are the 3 final prices pushed into discounted
5. it will throw an error because i is outside of block scope
6. Will log 150 because discounted price gets reassigned value each loop and the last value is 300/2 = 150
7. It will log 150, because that's the last discounted price with that round stuff applied to it
8. It will return [50,100,150] because those are the 3 final prices pushed into discounted
9. it will throw an error because i is outside of block scope
10. Will log 3 becayse that is the length of prices
11. It will return [50,50,50] because discountedPrice is a const
12. A. student.name;
    B. student["Grad Year"];
    C. student["greeting"];
    D. student["Favorite Teacher"].name
    E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. A. '32' converts 2 to a string
    B. 1 converts to an int because of subtraction
    C. 3 because null goes to 0
    D.'3null' because null goes to 'null'
    E. 4 because true goes to 1
    F. 0 both eval to 0
    G. '3undefined' undefined to 'undefined
    H. NaN undefined to NaN throws it all off
14. A. true convertes to ints
    B. false stays as strings
    C. false converts to ints
    D. false checks without type conversion
    E. false true evals to 1
    F. true boolean evals to true
15. === is strict equality, while == does conversion if the two items are different types
17. Tis will return [2,4,6] because it uses doSomething as the callback as it was passed into modifyArray correctly
19. 3 then 4, then 2 due to the timeout durations
